# G2-Mininet Sandbox

G2-Mininet provides a flexible way to create arbitrary (1) topologies, (2) routing schemes, and (3) flow configurations to analyze general network architectures with a focus on (although not limited to) understanding the bottleneck structure of high-speed communication networks (See [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). G2-Mininet uses Mininet with OpenFlow and POX to provide SDN capabilities and iPerf to generate traffic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Mininet
* Python 2.7
  * List of non-standard Python modules required: numpy, matplotlib, networkx, requests, psutil 
* sFlow-rt

Note: We have verified G2-Mininet works on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, although it should work on any distribution that supports Mininet.

### Installing

* Install Mininet by following the instructions at [Mininet Website](http://mininet.org/download/). The following installation and execution steps should be run from a machine (or VM) running Mininet.

* Download `sFlow-rt`

  ```shell
  cd $HOME
  wget https://inmon.com/products/sFlow-RT/sflow-rt.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf sflow-rt.tar.gz
  ```
* Note: following Macros are used in the steps below (please replace these with the paths specific to your installation):
  * `$MININET_SRC` represents the top of the Mininet installation directory, for example `/home/mininet/mininet/`
  * `$G2_MININET_SRC` represents the path to `g2-mininet` source code, for example `$MININET_SRC/g2-mininet`

* Clone `g2-mininet` repo and deploy scripts:

  ```shell
  cd $MININET_SRC
  git clone https://github.com/reservoirlabs/g2-mininet.git
  cp g2-mininet/pox/g2_static.py $MININET_SRC/pox/ext/
  ```

### Running the Tests   
1. Start `sFlow-rt`: 
   1. ```shell
      cd $HOME
      cd sflow-rt
      ./start.sh
      ```
   
   The above commands will start `sflow-rt`, listening on port 6343 (for sFlow) and 8008 (for HTTP). Keep it running for the entire experiment run.
   
2. Steps to simulate and test a new custom network topology named **`custom_net`**:

   1. ```shell
      cd $G2_MININET_SRC
      mkdir experiments/custom_net/
      mkdir experiments/custom_net/input/
      ```

   2. Specify configurations in `experiments/custom_net/input/g2.conf` file.

   3. Specify traffic flow configurations in `experiments/custom_net/input/traffic.conf` file.

   4. ```shell
      sudo python g2Launcher.py -i experiments/custom_net/input/ -o experiments/custom_net/output/
      ```

   5. Open another terminal window and run:

      1. ```shell
         cd $MININET_SRC/pox
         ./pox.py --verbose openflow.of_01 --port=6633 g2_static --topo='$G2_MININET_SRC/experiments/custom_net/output/topo.json' --routing='$G2_MININET_SRC/experiments/custom_net/output/output_routing.conf'
         ```

   6. Output results and plots will be written to directory `experiments/custom_net/output/`.

3. An existing network example simulation can be run using that network's directory under `experiments/` and modifying  its`input/g2.conf` and `input/traffic.conf` as needed. For example, use the following commands to run `g2_network1`:

   1. ```shell
      cd $G2_MININET_SRC
      sudo python g2Launcher.py -i experiments/g2_network1/input/ -o experiments/g2_network1/output/
      cd $MININET_SRC/pox
      ./pox.py --verbose openflow.of_01 --port=6633 g2_static --topo='$G2_MININET_SRC/experiments/g2_network1/output/topo.json' --routing='$G2_MININET_SRC/experiments/g2_network1/output/output_routing.conf'
      ```

4. See `experiments/README` for details on existing example network configurations and results.

### Source Directory Structure

* Source hosted at: https://github.com/reservoirlabs/g2-mininet
* Directory structure:
  * `experiments`: Example networks tested with G2-Mininet.
  * `devtools`: Development utilities, not for release.
  * `pox`: POX modules that implement the SDN controller.
  * `util`: Utility scripts that can be used with G2-Mininet tests.
